# ACT Extension Directory
## This directory contains the files (and the heirarchy) for the ANSYS ACT extension.

## ANSYS extensions live here(for ANSYS student 32 bit):
C:\Program Files\ANSYS Student\v182\Addins\ACT\extensions

The 'FluxImport2' directory should be placed in there, along with the xml file

## Generally, the heirarchy is:

extensions/  
---FluxImport2.xml   
---FluxImport2/  
------FluxImport2.py  
------Images/  
---------fire.bmp  
---------cube.bmp  

## Also, I have included the fortran flux generator script and associated Makefile, for reference
